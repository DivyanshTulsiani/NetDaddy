# NetDaddy
The age of internet brings a lot of convenience but hey on the contrary our society is now more vulnerable to getting exposed vulnerable content freely flowing on the internet specially the younger one's. It is our responsiblility to protect them from Pornography/Nudity/Sexual Abuse

You might wonder as options like Safe Search exist then what is the need but hey did you know safe search can not handle where we shine

## âœ¨ Where we Shine âœ¨
1. Third-Party and Niche Websites
2. Creative Bypassing (Misspelled Words prOn instead of porn)
3. Inconsistencies (Safe Search is not available everywhere)

### Summary
SafeSearch is good for basic filtering,but it's not bulletproof.

It fails when:
1. It can't interpret context
2. It relies too much on automation
3. Developers can find work arounds easily
